                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a developer and Brooklynite based in New Jersey, who loves making apps that fascinate and help people in their daily lives. I have been a narrative designer for 5 years, starting in my sophmore year of college when I got bored of traditional writing. My main narrative tool is Twine, an electron app developed by Chris Klimas, that requires HTML/CSS/Javascript to publish browser narrative games. I developed basic HTML/CSS skills while writing in Twine and then decided to learn actual programming languages, Javascript and C#, after I graduated college. I've also dabbled into basic Python. Building cyber homes for stores, game studios, and individuals is my most favorite part of front-end development.</p>
